injecture
=========

A rewriting proxy prototype.

Usage
-----

    go get -u github.com/golang/dep/...
    dep ensure
    go build
    ./injecture

Visit, for example: http://localhost:8080/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_B-58_Hustler

There's a lot missing from this at the moment, most noticeably redirect handling.
